# 🔐 Password Generator

This script generates a random password of a specified length.

The user is prompted to enter the desired length of the password. The script then creates a password by randomly sampling characters from a predefined set of characters, which includes:

- 🔡 Lowercase letters (a-z)
- 🔠 Uppercase letters (A-Z)
- 🔢 Digits (0-9)
- 🔣 Special characters (!@#$%^&*()?).

The generated password is then printed to the console.

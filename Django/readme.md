Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is free and open-source, with a thriving community and a wealth of documentation.

## Key Features

- **Fast**: Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.
- **Secure**: Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes.
- **Scalable**: Djangoâ€™s component-based architecture means that you can use it to build both simple and complex applications.

## Installation

To install Django, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install django
```

## Creating a Project

To create a new Django project, run the following command:

```bash

## Running the Development Server

Navigate to your project directory and run the development server:

```bash
cd myproject
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now access your project at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Creating an App

To create a new app within your project, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

This will create a new directory `myapp` with the necessary files.
